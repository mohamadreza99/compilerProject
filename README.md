#### *by MR.F and P.M*
###### *the compiler project for the fundamentals of compiler design course in sbu during the spring semester*
###### this program generates a top down parser based on the giving grammer from a file with a fixed format for each production of it
###### this program generates first and follow sets and calculate predicts and then generates the parse table
###### you can get the conflicts by see the parse table
###### the boolean terms are handled by a LALR(1) given parser because the booleans can't be handled by a LL(1) parser
###### this program have a code generator unit that creats some assembly like codes based on a input valid syntax text
